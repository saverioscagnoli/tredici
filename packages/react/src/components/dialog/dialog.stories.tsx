                My name is Yoshikage Kira. I'm 33 years old. My house is in the
                northeast section of Morioh, where all the villas are, and I am
                not married. I work as an employee for the Kame Yu department
                stores, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don't
                smoke, but I occasionally drink. I'm in bed by 11 PM, and make
                sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a
                glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches
                before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until
                morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or
                stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my
                last check-up. I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who
                wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble
                myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would
                cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with
                society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although,
                if I were to fight I wouldn't lose to anyone.
